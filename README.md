# How likely is it for an NCAA Collegiate athlete to surpass an Olympian?
*A look at NCAA Collegiate Track & Field Champions in comparison to Olympians in the same events* 

# Executive Summary
Is it likely that the current collegiate Track & Field   Outdoor athlete’s finishing times and distances will surpass the finishing   times and distances of the Summer Olympic athletes who compete in the same   events? 
 

I’ll be using final times and distances from the 2019 NCAA Division I Outdoor Championships and the 2000-2016 Summer Olympic games. I’m assuming that all the data is available but face a challenge in gathering all of the Olympic data needed due to the wait time in receiving data from the International Olympic Committee.
# Motivation

Based on the collegiate T&F athletes in 2019, I want to know the speed and distance thresholds that the athletes would have to meet to surpass previous Olympic athletes? As a former Track & Field athlete who still attends competitions, I’m amazed at how athletic the current collegiate and Olympian competitors continue to be.  I’m someone who has role models that set world records in the 1980s that are still in place in 2020, so I’m curious to see how close the current collegiate athletes and Olympians are to beating those world records.
# Data Questions

Is it likely that the current collegiate Track & Field   Outdoor athlete’s finishing times and distances will surpass the finishing times and distances of the Summer Olympic athletes who compete in the same events? 
 
Scope: Individual Events for Men and Women
1. 100M
2. 200M
3. 400M
4. 110M Hurdles
5. 100M Hurdles(W)
6. Shot Put
7. Long Jump
   
Based on the 2019 NCAA T&F Outdoor Championship athletes, would any of the athletes finishing times or distances   surpass the Summer 2016 Olympic medalists?
1. Over the past three years (2017-2019), how often was an NCAA record set by an athlete at the current Championship meet?
2. Did the NCAA record surpass the record from the previous Summer Olympic games?
3. How have finishing times changed for the 100m run over the last five Summer Olympics (16 years) to determine the fastest   man and woman in the world?
	
    a. How have the finishing times changed over the past three years (2017-2019) for collegiate athletes?
4. How often do younger athletes win over the older athletes in the Summer Olympics?*

# Challenges & Rewards

*DOB data is readily available for Olympic athletes, however, if I want to compare the ages of NCAA Collegiate Athletes to Olympians, the DOB data would have to be scraped from Wikipedia for NCAA athletes individually since DOBs aren’t typically listed for a collective set of athletes.
